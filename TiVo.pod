=head1 DESCRIPTION

    TiVo.pm provides a Perl interface to the TiVo Calypso protocol,
    allowing development of custom server and CGI applications to
    act as a media source for the TiVo consumer platform.

    TiVo.pm depends on the following third-party modules for
    full functionality:

        Storable        ( enables caching )
        Digest::MD5     ( enables caching )
        IO::File        ( enables general file serving )
        MP3::Info       ( enables MP3 serving )
        Image::Magick   ( enables image serving )

    TiVo.pm defines the following classes:

        TiVo::Server
        TiVo::Request
        TiVo::Container
            TiVo::Container::Server
            TiVo::Container::Music
        TiVo::Item
            TiVo::Item::MP3

    TiVo::Photos and it's related items (TiVo::Item::GIF,
    TiVo::Item::JPG, and TiVo::Item::PNG) have been removed from
    this branch release as I have not encountered anyone in the
    TiVo Community forums (www.tivocommunity.com) using these
    features.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

    TiVo::Server->new()
        Expects a hash of arguments to define the new Calypso
        server:

        SERVER_NAME defines the string by which the server
        identifies itself. It is purely cosmetic. (optional)

        CACHE_DIR defines the directory used to cache data
        objects and scaled images. This directory must be
        readable and writable in order for caching to take
        place.

    TiVo::Server->add_service()
        Expects to be passed a TiVo::Container object which
        will be added to the master list of services
        available on this server.

    TiVo::Server->request( $script_name, $path_info, $query_string )
        Expects to be passed three scalars (or a single
        predefined TiVo::Request object) of the same format as
        the environment variables SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO, and
        QUERY_STRING defined by a standard web server.

        TiVo::Server->request returns a list with 2 elements.
        The first element is a reference to a hash which
        contains the recommended HTTP headers to be returned
        to the client. The second element is a reference
        to either a scalar or an IO::File object, depending
        on the type of data requested.

        TiVo::Server->request returns undef on a bad request.

    TiVo::Container::Music->new()
        Expects a hash of arguments to define a service
        (directory of content):

        PATH defines the directory on the local filesystem
        to search for content to be made available via
        this service.

        SERVICE is the virtual directory name which will be
        used to describe this service in URLs.

        TITLE is the descriptive label which will be used to
        describe this service in messages from the server.
        (optional)

=head1 MODIFICATIONS

    TiVo.pm has been declared 'dead' by TiVo Inc. and released
    into the public domain.

    Additional modifications since the initial 1.0 release from
    TiVo include the following:

        Aggressive caching has been fixed.

        A smarter sort method has been implemented..

        AudioScrobbler (last.fm) support has been added.  The
        synopsis should be enough to explain how to use it.

        TiVo::Container::Music now defaults to an alphabetical
        list for browsing.  200+ artists made browsing terribly
        painful.

        Shuffled playlist - see TiVoConnect.cgi (included) for
        more details.  It's pretty much what it says it is.
